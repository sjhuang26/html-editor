When making a real-world HTML websites, the following template is often used to help keep things organized:
```
<html>
    <body>
        [Website content]
    </body>
</html>
```

* All website content (paragraphs, headers, etc.) is inside a single ```body``` tag.
* The ```body``` tag is inside a single ```html``` tag. Note how everything is inside the ```html``` tag.

However, this template is cumbersome to type out, so it is not used very often in this tutorial.

## Formatting

Note how the code is formatted. Tags are indented more when they are inside another tag. For example, the ```p``` tag is inside the ```body``` tag, so it is indented more. This is not required, but it makes it more obvious which tags are inside other tags.

Indents are the same as tabs, which can be typed by pushing the TAB key on your computer. Tabs are like spaces that are wider than usual.
